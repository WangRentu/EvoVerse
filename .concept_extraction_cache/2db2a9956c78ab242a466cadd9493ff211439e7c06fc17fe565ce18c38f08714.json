      "description": "A proposed neural pathway where medial habenula (MHb) activates interpeduncular nucleus (IPN), which stimulates median raphe nucleus (MRN) to release serotonin. This circuit promotes slow wave sleep (SWS) and suppresses theta oscillations, forming a core mechanism for sleep-wake regulation and memory processing.",

      "description": "A neural pathway involving supramammillary area (SUM) projections to medial septum (MS), inducing hippocampal theta rhythm during active wakefulness. This circuit supports memory encoding through spatio-temporal context binding and is antagonized by the SWS-promoting MHb-IPN-MRN circuit.",
