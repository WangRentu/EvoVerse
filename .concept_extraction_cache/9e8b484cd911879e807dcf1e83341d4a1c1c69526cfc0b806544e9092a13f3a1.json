      "name": "Sleep Quality",
      "description": "The subjective and objective assessment of restorative sleep, including factors like sleep continuity and depth. It significantly impacts cognitive functions critical for academic learning, such as information retention and focus during classroom activities.",

      "name": "Sleep Duration",
      "description": "The total time spent sleeping per 24-hour period, measured in hours. It demonstrates a strong positive correlation with GPA and overall academic performance, though its relationship with standardized test scores shows inconsistent findings across studies.",

      "name": "Daytime Sleepiness",
      "description": "The propensity to fall asleep during waking hours, often measured via scales like the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. It negatively correlates with classroom attention and information processing efficiency, directly impairing academic engagement and learning outcomes.",

      "name": "Memory Consolidation",
      "description": "The neural process by which short-term memories are stabilized into long-term storage during sleep, particularly during slow-wave and REM stages. This mechanism is foundational for academic learning, enabling retention of classroom material and knowledge integration.",

      "name": "Attentional Focus",
      "description": "The cognitive ability to maintain concentration on academic tasks during classroom instruction. Sleep deprivation directly impairs this function, leading to reduced information absorption and increased academic errors.",

      "name": "GPA",
      "description": "Grade Point Average, a standardized metric of academic performance calculated from course grades. It serves as a primary outcome variable in most studies, consistently showing positive correlation with adequate sleep duration and quality.",

      "name": "Standardized Test Scores",

      "name": "Sleep Intervention",
      "description": "Strategies designed to modify sleep patterns, such as delayed school start times or sleep hygiene education. These interventions show promise for improving sleep metrics but require longitudinal validation for academic impact.",
